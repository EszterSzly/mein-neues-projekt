to create a cozy, welcoming space where plant-based food and good coffee come together. 
Inspired by a love for animals, nature, and flavor, we wanted to offer something kind, creative, and delicious.
Everything on our menu is made with care â€” fully vegan, often seasonal, and always full of taste. 
Whether you are vegan or just curious, weâ€™re happy to have you here.ðŸ’š`} />
